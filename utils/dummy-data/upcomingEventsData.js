      "The theme this time is 'Relationships'. Human relations are a beautiful blend of warmth, perspectives, experiences, and belongingness. The relationship with yourself especially, is your best investment. Have you ever said things out loud to someone else and discovered something new about yourself? Or openly talked about problems with friends and suddenly found a solution? That‚Äôs what we also need with ourself. A bond of trust where we can openly communicate and admit certain things and minimise problems and confusions. So come join us!",

    Not only a session but a wholesome experience of being brave enough to pour your hearts out to strangers in exchange for support and encouragement. The participants unveiled answers to others‚Äô deep questions and we were enlightened about lesser known and intriguing topics like 'gaslighting' and 'the law of attraction'. üåà .

Eventually, an aura of confidence, stronger opinions and new connections took over the room. The four walls which otherwise should have been confining, perhaps created the most liberated space‚ú®
